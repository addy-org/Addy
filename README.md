# Addy
Like you have an Email ID, for addresses you have Addy! An app that changes the whole addressing system of the world, reducing the hassle of remembering the old, long addresses. Your 'Addy' is a 7 digit unique code that points to your location on the basis of its latitudinal and longitudinal position, giving you all the information of the place and the the way to approach it using the mighty Google Maps. It is so accurate that every building of the world has been assigned a different Addy with a minimum distance of 11.132m.
